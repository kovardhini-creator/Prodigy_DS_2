# Violin Plot – Age Distribution by Survival Status

🎯 Task-02 | Prodigy Infotech Internship



# Objective

-- To visualize the distribution of age between people who survived and those who did not using a violin plot. This helps to understand the age-based survival pattern using a visually rich and detailed chart.


# Project Summary

-- This project uses a small, manually created dataset (no CSV file used) that mimics Titanic-like data, containing information such as:

-- Gender (sex)

-- Age (age)

-- Survival status (survived)

-- A violin plot is used to show:

-- Distribution of ages

-- Density (spread and frequency)

-- Median values for each survival category



# Tools & Technologies

-- Python

-- Pandas – for managing the dataset

-- Seaborn – for advanced visualization

-- Matplotlib – for plot customization


📌 Key Learning Outcomes

-- Understanding violin plots as a tool to represent distribution

-- Exploring age-related survival patterns

-- Using manual datasets effectively in data science projects



# Visualization Output

-- A violin plot with:

-- X-axis: Survival status (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)

-- Y-axis: Age

-- Colors: Cool tones for a clean and professional look

-- The wider parts of the "violin" show where the ages are more densely populated.
